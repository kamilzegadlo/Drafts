A simple portal with ads with two user interfaces: MVC5 and angularjs.

It was my first use of:
-> entity framework (i used to use nhibernate)
-> mvc framewrok from visual studio
-> automapper
-> SpecFlow and Gherkin language
-> SignalR

I am used to work with very big projects where I add new features and fix bugs. 
That's why it was so great to write this project from scratch and first use several new tools. 

I was very positive surpised with Entity Framework, it really greate cooperate with Linq. Nhibernate's HQL and API is much more dificult to use, it takes time to get familiar with them.

Automapper is cool, it saves a boring mapping to/from DTOs and ViewModels.

Specflow and Gherkin are powerful if bussiness analists really use them to create project's specification. But i am not sure that gherkin is simple enough.

MVC framework from visual studio is not bad, i was little frustrated that it's not easy to move viewmodels from Model folder etc. It took much less time to build UI than building it in angular. The latter tool gives us more possibilities (two way binding, directives etc.) but it takes much more time to create something.
Angular's documentation is much better nowadays than it was 2 years ago, but it's still not easy to use it. Lack of intellisense and checking typo in our code are sensitible. I spent plenty of time on fixing typo issues.

SignalR is cool but... i don't see many opportunities to use it. Yeah, a chat is a perfect opportunity to use it but what else? A progress bar? Maybe.
